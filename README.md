# Instagram-Reach-Analysis-Project
Instagram Reach Prediction Data Analytics Project This repository contains a data analytics project focused on predicting the reach of Instagram posts using time series analysis and the SARIMA model. The project aims to provide insights and forecast future reach, enabling users to optimize their content strategy and marketing efforts on Instagram.

Project Overview The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that utilizes historical Instagram reach data to forecast the reach of posts or accounts in the future. By analyzing patterns, trends, and seasonality, the model can provide valuable insights and predictions for optimizing content strategies and maximizing reach on Instagram.

Data preprocessing is essential to ensure the data is in the correct format for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, data smoothing, removing outliers, and transforming the data if necessary.

Model Development and Evaluation The SARIMA model is employed in this project to capture the temporal patterns and seasonality present in the Instagram reach data. The model is developed using the statsmodels library and is trained on the historical data.

Model evaluation is performed to assess the accuracy and performance of the trained SARIMA model. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and forecast accuracy are computed to measure the model's effectiveness.

Results and Interpretation The prediction results obtained from the trained SARIMA model are stored in the results/ directory. Visualizations and summaries of the predicted reach are provided, along with the evaluation metrics. These results can be used to make informed decisions regarding content strategies and marketing efforts on Instagram.
